Title: AI-Powered Health Advisor: Image Analysis and Voice Interaction

I developed an AI-powered Health Advisor using cutting-edge technologies like Google's Generative AI and speech recognition to enhance user interaction. This project allows users to upload images, particularly of food, and ask questions about them using voice commands.

Key Features:

Image Analysis: Utilizes Google's Generative AI to analyze uploaded images of food, providing detailed responses based on the image content.

Voice Interaction: Integrated speech recognition technology enables users to verbally ask questions about the uploaded image. The AI assistant then generates spoken responses and converts them into audible speech.

Accessibility: Designed with ease of use in mind, the application provides a seamless experience for users to interact naturally via both visual and auditory channels.

Multi-modal Output: Outputs include text-based responses displayed on the interface, as well as audio responses played back to the user in real-time, enhancing accessibility and user engagement.

Technologies Used: Python libraries such as Streamlit for the frontend, Google's Generative AI for image analysis, SpeechRecognition for voice input, gTTS for text-to-speech conversion, and pygame for audio playback ensure robust functionality and performance.

This project showcases the potential of AI in health-related applications, bridging the gap between visual data analysis and interactive user interfaces. Ideal for anyone interested in AI, healthcare innovation, or enhancing user experience through multi-modal interaction.
